# crypto-clustering-challenge
Module 19 Challenge: Unsupervised Learning

## Introduction

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Assignment components

* Normalizing the data (get all variables to the same z-score scale with a mean of 0 and std of 1)
* Assessing the number of appropriate clusters using the elbow method
* initiating the cluster model, fitting the data, and making cluster predictions, then visualize the results focusing on two features
* Reducing the dimentionality of the data by applying the PCA model (requesting 3 components)
* Assessing the number of appropriate clusters, on the reduced features, using the elbow method
* Initiating the cluster model on the reduced features (the 3 components), fitting the data, and making cluster predictions, then visualize the results focusing on two principal components
* Creating composite plots 1) for the elbow method for the original and after employing pca 2) for assessing the predicted cluster
* Compare results and assess solutions difference
